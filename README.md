Tech Stack:

Backend: Firebase, Firestore, Firestore cloud functions (go)
Frontend: Sveltekit
Data Propagation: Python

why

Firestore as a relation db is not as good as something like postgres but I don't really care cause I don't want to go through the pain of creating a postgres db and ngnix and hosting and docker and pain

Sveltekit has nice SSO and i love svelte

Python becuase it supports AI libs and Josh likes it
