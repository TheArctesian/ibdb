# Client
I am going to do this in [sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
and backend [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

For running and editing

Make sure ur nodejs and NPM is up to date
Make sure you have yarn installed
```shell
$ npm install -g yarn
```

Then you are ready
```shell
$ cd app/
$ yarn install 
$ yarn run build
$ yarn run dev --open
```
